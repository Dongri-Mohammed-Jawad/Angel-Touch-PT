							<i>What do Physical Therapists do?</i>
							Physical Therapists help decrease pain and increase/restore movement, most often without pricy.<br>
							surgery while decreasing/eliminating need to depend on prescription medications.<br><br></p>
							<h3 class="color-text">Common conditions we treat:</h3><br>
<p style="font-size:17px;">							<b>Acute &amp; Chronic Pain : </b><br>
							Acute pain usually comes on suddenly and is caused by something specific. It is sharp in quality. Acute pain usually does not last longer than six months. It goes away when there is no longer an underlying cause for the pain.Chronic pain can affect any part of the body and people of any age, including children.
							<br>
<b>Neck &amp; Back Pain</b><br>
The most common cause of acute back or neck pain is a muscle injury, in which muscle fibers stretch too far and tear. Muscle injury may be caused by overuse, such as from heavy lifting, as well as by repetitive motions that put continual stress on the back or neck muscles.<br>

<b>Frozen Shoulder (Adhesive Capsulitis)</b><br>
Adhesive capsulitis and frozen shoulder syndrome (FSS) are two terms that have been used to describe a painful and stiff shoulder. <br>

<b>Rotator Cuff Tendonitis</b><br>
Rotator cuff tendinitis, or tendonitis, affects the tendons and muscles that help move your shoulder joint. If you have tendinitis, it means that your tendons are inflamed or irritated. Rotator cuff tendinitis is also called impingement syndrome.<br>

<b>Impingement Syndrome</b><br>
impingement syndrome is a common cause of shoulder pain. It occurs when there is impingement of tendons or bursa in the shoulder from bones of the shoulder. <br>

<b>Superior Labral Tears</b><br>
A SLAP tear is a torn piece of cartilage in the inner portion of the shoulder joint. It can be painful and/or limit movement in the shoulder, especially overhead motions.<br>

<b>AC Joint Injuries</b><br>
An acromioclavicular (AC) joint injury is commonly referred to as "shoulder separation" and should not be confused with a shoulder dislocation. <br>

<b>Tennis or Golfers Elbow</b><br>
You don’t have to be Roger Federer or Phil Mickelson to have it. Even if you’ve never played a set of tennis or a round of golf, you can still suffer from these elbow injuries. Tennis Elbow and Golfer’s Elbow are both overuse injuries that are caused by any activity that requires repetitive motion of the arm and wrist. <br>

<b>Post UCL Re-construction</b><br>
Injuries to the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in throwing athletes frequently occurs from the repetitive valgus loading of the elbow during the throwing motion, which often results in surgical reconstruction of the UCL requiring a structured postoperative rehabilitation program. <br>

<b>Post Total Elbow Arthroplasty</b><br>
Total elbow arthroplasty has continued to evolve over time. Elbow implants may be linked or unlinked. Unlinked implants are attractive for patients with relatively well preserved bone stock and ligaments, but many favor linked implants, since they prevent instability and allow replacement for a wider spectrum of indications.<br>

<b>Pronator Teres Syndrome</b><br>
Pronator teres syndrome is a compression neuropathy of the median nerve at the elbow. <br>

<b>Post Total Hip and Knee Replacements</b><br>
The prostheses for a total hip replacement (total hip arthroplasty) can be inserted into the pelvis and femur with or without cement. The options are customized for each patient by the orthopedic surgeon.<br>

<b>Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome</b><br>
Patellofemoral pain syndrome is a broad term used to describe pain in the front of the knee and around the patella, or kneecap. It is sometimes called "runner's knee" or "jumper's knee". <br>

<b>Post Patellar Tendor &amp; Quad Tendon Repair</b><br>
When the quadriceps tendon ruptures, the patella loses its anchoring support in the thigh. Without this anchoring effect of the intact quadriceps tendon, the patella tends to move inferiorly (towards the foot).<br>

<b>Patellar Tendonitis</b><br>
Patellar tendinopathy (or as it is commonly known patellar tendonitis or tendinitis) is an overuse injury affecting your knee. It is the result of your patella tendon being overstressed. A common name for it is Jumper's Knee.<br>

<b>Post ACL Re-construction</b><br>
To gain good functional stability, repair muscle strength, reach the best possible functional level and to decrease the risk for re-injury.<br>

<b>Hip Bursitis</b><br>
Most commonly, bursitis is a noninfectious condition (aseptic bursitis) caused by inflammation that results from local soft-tissue trauma or strain injury.<br>

<b>Herniated/Bulging Disk</b><br>
“A herniated disk results when a crack in the tough outer layer of cartilage allows some of the softer inner cartilage to protrude out of the disk.A bulging disk doesn't always affect the entire perimeter of a disk, only the outer layer of tough cartilage is involved.”<br>

<b>Sciatica</b><br>
Sciatica pain is typically felt from the low back to behind the thigh and radiating down below the knee.<br>

<b>Planter Fasciitis</b><br>
Plantar fasciitis (PLAN-tur fas-e-I-tis) is one of the most common causes of heel pain. It involves inflammation of a thick band of tissue that runs across the bottom of your foot and connects your heel bone to your toes (plantar fascia).<br>
<b>Achilles Tendonitis</b><br>
Achilles tendinitis is a common condition that occurs when the large tendon that runs down the back of your lower leg becomes irritated and inflamed. <br>
<b>Peroneal Tendonitis</b><br>
Peroneal tendonitis is inflammation of the peroneal tendons which run behind the lateral malleolus or the bony bit on the outside of the ankle causing and swelling on the outer ankle.<br>

<b>Ankle Sprain</b><br>
An ankle sprain is an injury to the tough bands of tissue (ligaments) that surround and connect the bones of the leg to the foot. <br>

<b>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</b><br>
Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition that causes pain, numbness, and tingling in the hand and arm. The condition occurs when one of the major nerves to the hand — the median nerve — is squeezed or compressed as it travels through the wrist. <br>

<b>Post-Surgical Rehab</b><br>
Post surgery, one needs to go through various exercises to optimize results and come back to their best self. <br>

<b>Weight Management</b><br>
Physiotherapy provides the physical activity component of multidisciplinary weight management services.<br>
<b>Sports injury</b><br>
Sports injuries are injuries that occur in athletic activities or exercising.<br>

<b>Spinal &amp; Joint Dysfunction</b><br>
Sacroiliac joint dysfunction is improper movement of the joints at the bottom of the spine that connect the sacrum to the pelvis. It can result in pain in the low back and legs, or inflammation of the joints known as sacroiliitis.<br>
<b>Balance Training</b><br>
Balance training involves doing exercises that strengthen the muscles that help keep you upright, including your legs and core. These kinds of exercises can improve stability and help prevent falls.<br>

<b>Headaches &amp; Dizziness</b><br>
Dizziness that accompanies a headache could be a sign of a migraine, but it can also be related to others factors. <br>

<b>General De-conditioning</b><br>
Deconditioning is a complex process of physiological change following a period of inactivity, bedrest or sedentary lifestyle. It results in functional losses in such areas as mental status, degree of continence and ability to accomplish activities of daily living. It is frequently associated with hospitalization in the elderly.

                            <p style="font-size:17px;"><img src="assets/img/blog/4.jpg" class="img-responsive" />Acupuncture is a form of treatment that involves inserting very thin needles through a person's skin at specific points on the body, to various depths.<br><br>
					   
					   Research suggests that it can help relieve pain, and it is used for a wide range of other complaints.<br><br>

However, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), there is limited evidence for its effectiveness in areas other than pain.<br><br>

How acupuncture works scientifically remains unclear. Some people claim it works by balancing vital energy, while others believe it has a neurological effect.<br><br>

Acupuncture remains controversial among Western medical doctors and scientists.
					   </p>
					   <h3>What is Acupuncture?</h3>
					   <p style="font-size:17px;">
						An acupuncurist will insert needles into a person's body with the aim of balancing their energy.<br><br>

This, it is claimed, can help boost wellbeing and may cure some illnesses.<br><br>

Conditions it is used for include different kinds of pain, such as headaches, blood pressure problems, and whooping cough, among others.
					   </p>
					   <h3>How does it work?</h3>
					   <p style="font-size:17px;">
						Traditional Chinese medicine explains that health is the result of a harmonious balance of the complementary extremes of "yin" and "yang" of the life force known as "qi," pronounced "chi." Illness is said to be the consequence of an imbalance of the forces.<br><br>

Qi is said to flow through meridians, or pathways, in the human body. These meridiens and energy flows are accessible through 350 acupuncture points in the body.<br><br>

Inserting needles into these points with appropriate combinations is said to bring the energy flow back into proper balance.<br><br>

There is no scientific proof that the meridians or acupuncture points exist, and it is hard to prove that they either do or do not, but numerous studies suggest that acupuncture works for some conditions.<br><br>

Some experts have used neuroscience to explain acupuncture. Acupuncture points are seen as places where nerves, muscles, and connective tissue can be stimulated. The stimulation increases blood flow, while at the same time triggering the activity of the body's natural painkillers.<br><br>

It is difficult to set up investigations using proper scientific controls, because of the invasive nature of acupuncture. In a clinical study, a control group would have to undergo sham treatment, or a placebo, for results to be compared with those of genuine acupuncture.<br><br>

Some studies have concluded that acupuncture offers similar benefits to a patient as a placebo, but others have indicated that there are some real benefits.

                            <div class="vs-25"></div>
                            <p style="font-size:17px;"><img src="assets/img/blog/Image_3_1-1200x600-1.jpg" class="img-responsive" />Orthopedic braces are medical devices designed to address musculoskeletal issues; they are used to properly align, correct the position, support, stabilize, and protect certain parts of the body (particularly the muscles, joints, and bones) as they heal from injury or trauma. These medical devices are often prescribed for the patient to wear during the process of recovery and rehabilitation.
					   <br><br>
					   Many specialized healthcare fields use orthopaedic braces, including those concerned with rehabilitating and preventing injuries, post-operative care, osteoarthritic care, and more. A qualified medical professional can determine what type of orthopaedic brace is ideal for the patient, as well as the fit, type of support, function, and level of stability or protection.
					   <br><br>
					   Orthopaedic devices fall under the medical specialty of orthotics, a field that involves the design, manufacture, and application of orthopaedic braces and other similar devices that are used outside the patient’s body to modify or improve the function and structure of the affected muscles and bones.
					   <br><br>
					   It is important to note, however, that orthopaedic braces should not be worn without the advice or recommendation of a doctor and an orthotist, who is a clinician responsible for prescribing, manufacturing, managing, and monitoring orthopaedic braces and other orthoses.
					   <br><br>
					   Orthopaedic braces can be used in various ways. They can be prescribed to stop limbs, specific segments of the body, or joints from moving for a pre-determined period. This can be very important in facilitating proper recovery and positioning as the affected body part heals. Braces are often recommended for restricting and assisting general movement, removing weight from healing or injured joints and muscles, and correcting the shape and function to reduce pain and facilitate improved mobility. Patients who have suffered from fractures or broken bones can also be prescribed orthopaedic braces to aid in musculoskeletal rehabilitation.

                            <div class="vs-25"></div>
                            <p style="font-size:17px;"><img src="assets/img/blog/2.jpg" class="img-responsive" />Sports injuries refer to the kinds of injury that occur during sports or exercise. While it is possible to injure any part of the body when playing sports, the term sports injuries is commonly used to refer to injuries of the musculoskeletal system.
					   
					   <b>Some of the most common sports injuries include:</b>
					   <ul style="font-size:17px;">
						<li><b>Sprains </b>— tears to the ligaments that join the ends of bones together. The ankles, knees, and wrists are commonly affected by sprains.</li>
						<li><b>Strains </b>— pulls or tears of muscles or tendons (the tissues that attach the muscles to the bones)</li>
						<li>"<b>Shin splints</b>"—pain along the outside front of the lower leg, commonly seen in runners</li>
						<li><b>Achilles tendonitis or rupture of the Achilles tendon</b> — These injuries involve the large band of tissue that connects the calf muscles to the heel</li>
						<li><b>Fractures</b> of the bones</li>
						<li><b>Dislocation of joints</b></li>
					   </ul>
					   <p style="font-size:17px;">
						Acute injuries usually occur suddenly while participating in sports or exercise. They may result in sudden and severe pain, the inability to bear weight on a limb, or inability to move the affected part of the body. Chronic injuries usually result from overuse of one area of the body over a period of time. Symptoms of chronic injuries include soreness, dull aching pain, and pain during participation in physical activity.
						<br>
						<b>What happens to the tissues after an acute injury?</b>
						<br><br>
						When a runner "pulls a groin" or a tennis player "strains a tendon," the soft tissues in the area of pain are injured. Immediately after the injury, there are disrupted fibers of the affected muscle, tendon, and/or ligament. Additionally, the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that normally supply blood and oxygen to these tissues are broken. The broken capillaries then leak varying amounts of blood and serum into the adjacent tissues. Therefore, soon after a soft tissue injury, localized swelling occurs. The injured tissues become painful and tender, both directly from the trauma to them and indirectly from the subsequent swelling. This leads to the stiffness, pain, and tenderness that so often accompany the inflammation of tendinitis, bursitis, as well as strain and sprain injuries. It should also be noted that even a bone injury (such as a fracture) is typically accompanied by injury to the nearby soft tissues.</p>

                            <p style="font-size:17px;"><img src="assets/img/blog/3.jpg" class="img-responsive" />Walking your dog in a park. Dashing down a basketball court. Mowing your lawn. We usually don’t think about the great gift we have to move, bend, lift, throw or push without limitation. But an injury or illness can take away those abilities and suddenly everyday activities become extraordinary tasks.<br><br>

Physical rehabilitation is the process of restoring and regaining physical strength and function. Physical rehabilitation can be used to help treat a simple ankle sprain or to help a stroke survivor walk, talk and eat again.<br><br>

“Physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians, nurses and physical, occupational, speech and recreation therapists work as a team to help patients reduce their dependency on others and achieve the highest level of functional independence,” says Frank Hyland, vice president of rehabilitation for Good Shepherd Rehabilitation Network. “Successful rehabilitation helps you get back to doing the things you love with the people you love.”
					   <br><br>
					   <b>The Physical Rehabilitation Process</b>
					   <br>
					   Rehabilitation is a different experience for everyone, but care typically progresses in the following way:<br><br>
					   <ul style="font-size:17px;">
						<li><b>Acute or Physician Care: To Stabilize Your Condition</b> - For serious injuries and medical conditions like stroke, brain injury or multiple traumas, inpatient rehabilitation care follows an acute-care hospital stay. For injuries like sprains, strains and fractures, a visit to a physician will be the first line of care.</li>
						<li><b>Inpatient Rehabilitation: To Regain Function and Independence </b>- Patients typically receive at least three hours of physical, occupational, speech or recreational therapy each day at a rehabilitation facility such as Good Shepherd Rehabilitation Hospital-Allentown. A multidisciplinary team of physicians, therapists and nurses develop and oversee a treatment plan to meet individual goals.</li>
						<li><b>Outpatient Rehab: To Maintain and Improve Function </b>- Patients who are discharged from inpatient rehabilitation will continue therapy in an outpatient facility, such as Good Shepherd Physical Therapy. Patients with less serious conditions may be referred right to an outpatient facility for treatment. Maintaining function on an ongoing basis may include joining a medical-model fitness center, fitness class or support group.</li>
